\title{Generates an expanded version of a dataset that contains survival data}
\usage{
lexisDS(data, intervalWidth, idCol, entryCol, exitCol, statusCol, variables)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a character, the name of the data frame that holds the original data, this is the data to be expanded.}

\item{intervalWidth,}{a numeric vector which gives the chosen width of the intervals ('pieces').
This can be one value (in which case all the intervals that same width) or several different values.
If no value(s) is(are) provided a single default value is used. hat default value is the set to be the
1/10th of the mean across all the studies.}

\item{idCol}{a characte,r the name of the column that holds the individual IDs of the subjects.}

\item{entryCol}{a character, the name of the column that holds the entry times (i.e. start of follow up).
If no name is provided the default is to set all the entry times to 0 in a column named "STARTTIME".
A message is then printed to alert the user as this has serious consequences if the actual entry times are
not 0 for all the subjects.}

\item{exitCol}{a character, the name of the column that holds the exit times (i.e. end of follow up).}

\item{statusCol}{a character, the name of the column that holds the 'failure' status of each subject,
tells whether or not a subject has been censored.}

\item{variables}{a character vector, the column names of the variables (covariates) to include in the
final expanded table. The input table might have a large number of covariates and if only some of those
variables are relevant for the sought analysis it make sense to only include those. By default (i.e. if
no variables are indicated) all the covariates in the inout table are included and this will lengthen the
run time of the function.}
}
\value{
a dataframe, an expanded version of the input tabl.
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used as part of a piecewise regression analysis.
}
\details{


It splits the survial interval time of subjects into sub-intervals and reports the failure
status of the subjects at each sub-interval. Each of those sub-interval is given an id e.g. if the overall
interval of a subject is split into 4 sub-interval, those sub-intervals have ids 1, 2, 3 and 4; so this is
basically the count of periods for each subject. The interval ids are held in a column named "TIMEID".
The entry and exit times in the input table are used to compute the total survival time.
By default all the covariates in the input table are included in the expanded output table but it is
preferable to indicate the names of the covariates to be included via the argument 'variables'.
